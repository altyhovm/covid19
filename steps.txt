1.within (examplefolder) copied externalJsExample and pasted into (newfolder) (as this will be an external file example (actually json)).
2. opened (newfolder/externalJsExample) folder opened example.html 
	2a. attempted search (which failed)(this is what it should do at this point.
	2b. using GithubDesktop, commited changes, then pushed.
	2c. with github pages in use via github (if not sure how to make public go to settings in github)
		opened a browser window and navigated to. 
		https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/example.html
		if this is successful, then it means the .json file has also been uploaded to github.
3. Within SublimeText (editor) opened newfodler/externalJsExample/scripts/AppleSearch4.js
	3a. within the code for the $.ajax, changed  
		url: " https://aaronlilly.github.io/ApiExample/Apple4/apple4.json"
			to 
		url: " https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/apple4.json"

4. Within GithubDeskTop commited changes and pushed to origin.
5. Opened webbrowser and navigated to 
"https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/apple4.json
	5a. if this is successful, we are on the right path!
	5b. navigated to https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/example.html
	5c. tested search, it was successful!!! (if not you did something wrong).
6. now that we have a working example, were going to do it all again.

7. within (newfolder) copied externalJsExample and pasted within same (newfolder) 
	7a. changed name of this copied folder
	7b. the reason i do this is if the example works, i want to get an alternate working next, so that if i mess up I can just go back to the example, I then can take the alternate, and turn it into my final project. this copied folder will be listed here as copiedfolder
	7c. within copiedfolder opened scripts/AppleSearch4.js (opened with SublimeText)
