newfolder name is determined by user.
replace https://aaronlilly.github.io with your io from github.

1.within (examplefolder) copied externalJsExample and pasted into (newfolder) (as this will be an external file example (actually json)).
2. opened (newfolder/externalJsExample) folder opened example.html 
	2a. attempted search (which failed)(this is what it should do at this point.
	2b. using GithubDesktop, commited changes, then pushed.
	2c. with github pages in use via github (if not sure how to make public go to settings in github)
		opened a browser window and navigated to. 
		https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/example.html
		if this is successful, then it means the .json file has also been uploaded to github.
3. Within SublimeText (editor) opened newfodler/externalJsExample/scripts/AppleSearch4.js
	3a. within the code for the $.ajax, changed  
		url: " https://aaronlilly.github.io/ApiExample/Apple4/apple4.json"
			to 
		url: " https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/apple4.json"
	3b. Saved AppleSearch4.js in SublimeText
4. Within GithubDeskTop commited changes and pushed to origin.
5. Opened webbrowser and navigated to 
"https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/apple4.json
	5a. if this is successful, we are on the right path!
	5b. navigated to https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/example.html
	5c. tested search, it was successful!!! (if not you did something wrong).
6. now that we have a working example, were going to do it all again.

7. within (newfolder) copied externalJsExample and pasted within same (newfolder) 
	7a. changed name of this copied folder
	7b. the reason i do this is if the example works, i want to get an alternate working next, so that if i mess up I can just go back to the example, I then can take the alternate, and turn it into my final project. this copied folder will be listed here as copiedfolder
	7c. within copiedfolder opened scripts/AppleSearch4.js (opened with SublimeText)
	changed  url: "https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/externalJsExample/apple4.json"
	to 
	 url: "https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/<copiedfolder>/apple4.json"
	(in this case it was https://aaronlilly.github.io/Coronavirus/covid19/apple4.json)
	7d. Saved in Sublime, commited and pushed in GithubDesktop
	7e. Opened https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/<copiedfolder>/apple4.json in web browser. success!
	7f. Opened https://aaronlilly.github.io/<newfolder>/<copiedfolder>/example.html	in web browser, and tried search function. this was successful!!! (in this case https://aaronlilly.github.io/Coronavirus/covid19/example.html)

8. with that working let's play!!! From now on we will only be working in the copiedfolder if you are paranoid like me, make another copy of it or just rely on git/github.

9. for this document the copiedfolder will now be refered to as ./cf/

10. now we get to decide what we want to do, first i want info to load when the page comes up this info will be replaced when i search something specific. 
	10a. before i get too fancy, i will try to get the site to append the word "hi" on load.
		10a1. within AppleSearch4.js I write the following code (after the end of the first function)
		 $(document).ready(function ()              {
                     {$(document).ready(function () {  
                                 $('#ArrayD').append("hi") })             };    });
